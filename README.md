# HTTP Proxy with Caching
This is an implementation of an HTTP proxy server in C++ that supports caching of responses. The proxy server forwards requests from clients to origin servers and caches the responses it receives. When a client requests a resource that is in the cache, the proxy can respond with the cached copy of the resource rather than re-fetching it from the origin server.
An http	proxy â€“ a	 server	 whose	 job	 it	 is	 to	 forward	

## Features
* Supports GET, POST, and CONNECT HTTP methods (other methods can be added)
* Caches responses to GET requests using expiration time and re-validation rules
* Handles multiple concurrent requests effectively using multiple threads
* Logs information about each request to /var/log/erss/proxy.log
* Assigns a unique identifier to each request for easy tracking in the log
* Prints useful log messages to help diagnose issues

## Getting Started 
1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:syhuang22/HTTP-Caching-Proxy.git`
2. Run the below command in HTTP-Caching-Proxy directory<br>
